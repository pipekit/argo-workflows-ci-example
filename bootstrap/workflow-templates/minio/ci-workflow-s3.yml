      A basic CI leveraging Argo Workflows.

      The Workflow...

      * pulls a repo from git. Specifically pulling a branch based on a pull request;
      * merges the target branch into it;
      * modifies the html that will be copied into the container to inject the unique name of the running workflow;
      * builds a container from a Dockerfile and pushes to a registry;
      * deploys an Argo CD application that uses the newly-built container to deploy a static website.

      It does not pretend to be a definitive example, but it aims to inspire. In order to make this a semi-usable example, we have cut a number of security corners. Please don't just blindly run this in production.
