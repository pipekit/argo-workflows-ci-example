# Argo Workflows - Example CI
A basic CI leveraging [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/).

## The Workflow...
* pulls a repo from git. Specifically pulling a branch based on a pull request;
* merges the target branch into it;
* modifies the html that will be copied into the container to inject the unique name of the running workflow;
* builds a container from a Dockerfile and pushes to a registry;
* deploys an Argo CD application that uses the newly-built container to deploy a static website.

It does not pretend to be a definitive example, but it aims to inspire.
In order to make this a semi-usable example, we have cut a number of security corners. Please don't just blindly run this in production.


# Software Versions Used:
This example installs a number of software packages:

- Argo CD (2.7.6)
- Argo Workflows (3.4.8)
- Ingress-Nginx (Helm Chart 4.6.0)
- nfs-server-provisioner (Helm Chart 1.8.0)
- Kubernetes 1.26

If you believe any to be out of date, a Pull Request is very welcome.

## Prerequisites
### Running Locally
In order to run this locally, you will need [k3d](https://k3d.io/) installed, as well as kubectl.
Your cluster will need to able to see the internet, specifically this repository in GitHub, because Argo CD pulls config to manage the installation of applications.

Note, this example spins up roughly 20 pods in the cluster, even before you run a workflow, so you'll need to allocate a half-decent amount of resources to Docker to run this example.

### Running on a remote cluster
The summary is "probably don't". If you really want to run on a remote cluster, you will need to use an empty cluster that you don't care about. This script blindly installs and configures a number of tools and has no regard for what you already have installed. It also makes assumptions about things like the container registry URL and ingress URLS that you will need to manually change in order to make it work.

You will need to remove the k3d cluster creation step from the script.

## Steps to Run
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
Once the setup is completed (3-7 mins depending on how sprightly your cluster is feeling), you can view the argo-workflows UI at https://localhost:8443/workflows/argo?limit=500 (the S in https is important and you'll need to accept the self-signed certificate). Make sure you are looking at the 'argo' namespace.

Then you can deploy the workflow and you should see it appear in the UI.
```
kubectl -n argo create -f workflow.yml 
```

Once the workflow has successfully run, you can navigate to https://localhost:8443/argo-workflows-ci-example/ in your browser. The website should tell you the branch that it was built from (the default is 'example') and the name of the workflow that built it.

You can delete the Argo CD application to remove the deployment. You should do this before re-running the workflow:
```
kubectl -n argocd delete application final-application
```

If you wish, you can modify the parameters in workflow.yml as follows and you'll build from our second example branch:
```
    parameters:
      - name: app_repo
        value: "argo-workflows-ci-example"
      - name: git_branch
        value: 'another-example'
      - name: target_branch
        value: 'main'
      - name: container_tag
        value: 'stable'
      - name: container_image
        value: "k3d-registry.localhost:5000/hello-world"
      - name: dockerfile
        value: Dockerfile
      - name: path
        value: "/CI"
```

You can of course adjust other parameters as you see fit, and keep running the workflows to experiment. You may need to change the final-application deployment.

# Deleting the cluster
```
k3d cluster delete workflows-ci
```

# Running in production
This is a very simplified workflow aiming to highlight what's possible using Argo Workflows. Some things to consider when running in production:

* Triggering the CI using Argo Events. You can use the [Resource Example from the Argo Events repository](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/blob/master/examples/sensors/resource.yaml) to help guide you in how to achieve this. In order for this to work, you will need a public-facing webhook ingress endpoint, which is why it's not included in this example.
* Storing secrets more sensibly and injecting them only when required. We use Hashicorp Vault to achieve this. We strongly advise against putting any secret into git.
* Leveraging things like AWS spot instances and the cluster autoscaler to keep node costs down.
* Using much more restrictive Argo CD and Argo Workflows RBAC policies.
* Using something like the [ci-github-notifier](https://github.com/sendible-labs/ci-github-notifier) to annotate pull requests and branches with the status of your CI.
* Use dedicated images for the job. Don't pull alpine and install git on each run, use a custom alpine-git image. We just did the example this way to reduce the number of dependencies required to get up and running.


# So what's happening?
## Setup
After creating a new local cluster, we install Argo CD, which is configured to look at the [bootstrap/applications](bootstrap/applications/) directory to install all other other applications.

Argo CD then continues to manage these applications, ensuring that your cluster reflects the configuration stored in Git.

Argo CD also deploys all our workflow templates for us. This means we don't have to manage a complex release process for them. We simply get them to the main branch of git (either directly, or through a proper Pull Request process with reviews etc) and Argo CD handles the deployment.

The [Argo Workflows Installation](bootstrap/argo-workflows/) is as out-of-the-box as we could make it while still providing an easy example. We adjust the controller config to ensure that Workflows releases PVCs when workflows are complete, as well as some other minor configuration for ease of demonstration. We patch the argo-server to disable a requirement for login, and to hide some popups that first-time users will see... again, all with the aim to make the example as smooth as possible.

Finally, because we intend on using the Workflow to deploy an application into the 'argocd' namespace from the 'argo' namespace, we adjust the Kubernetes rbac to allow the argo serviceAccount read/write access to the argocd namespace.

ingress-nginx is installed purely to allow you to access the Argo Workflows UI and the UI of your final application.

nfs-server-provisioner allows us to mount an NFS share into the workflow. This allows for multiple steps to interact with the same volume, even in parallel. nfs-server-provisioner uses disk on your nodes to achieve this. An alternative approach is to use Argo Workflows' archive feature to allow you to push data to a remote location such as S3.  For CI, this can be quite costly, pushing and pulling the data for each step in a workflow will not be efficient. Keeping the data as physically close to the compute as possible is a good idea.

## Workflow Logistics
The main workflow template that is being called is [ci-workflow.yaml](bootstrap/workflow-templates/ci-workflow.yml). This requests the appropriate volumes, optionally sets up some prometheus metrics and defines the actual DAG for the workflow.

Most of the other steps called with in that workflow are themselves in [their own workflow template](bootstrap/workflow-templates/). This makes it easier for future expansion, and means you don't need to write a duplicate workflow for each CI job. In order for this to work, you should parametrise as much as is sensibly possible within your workflow templates. We have done so here as an example, but there is probably room for improvement.

We would normally recommend taking the time to write custom templates for each workflow step, rather than using generic containers and installing/upgrading software on the fly [as we have done here]((bootstrap/workflow-templates/git-checkout.yml)). Reinstalling software on each workflow run is not efficient.

## Prometheus metrics
Your workflows can output useful metrics to allow you to track and alert on the performance of your CI jobs.
We have included some sample metrics here, but haven't gone to the length of installing and setting up prometheus. Feel free to do so!

After running the workflow at least once, you can port-forward to the workflow-controller service to view the metrics:

```
kubectl -n argo port-forward svc/workflow-controller-metrics 9090:9090
```

In your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:9090/metrics` to see the raw prometheus metrics.

## Using S3/Minio instead of NFS
Some people may choose to use s3 instead of NFS. This is possible, and we have written an example into this repo.

You can run the following command to trigger the same workflow, using minio to pass the artifacts between steps.

```
kubectl -n argo create -f workflow-s3.yml 
```

# Further Help and Support

## Mac Users
Monterey (MacOS 12) and greater users might find that the k3d cluster doesn't start due to port 5000 being in use.
It seems Apple has decided to automatically enable the Airplay Receiver option in the Sharing menu of System Preferences. You can either disable this, or change port 5000 in this repo to something else.
